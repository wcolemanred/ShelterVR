# Shelter Project by Salesforce

**Disclaimer:** Salesforce employees created this project as a demonstration environment. It is provided as-is without official support from Salesforce.

## About
The goal of the Shelter project is to learn about the shelter needs of displaced people. The participants will take the role of a business that up-cycles shipping containers to provide shelters to aid agencies around the world.
 
The project involves a Salesforce Lightning application and an interactive Virtual Reality (VR) application.
 
The Lightning application allows creating a ‘Brief’ based on requirements (budget, location, aid agency…). Participants create a configuration (bill of materials) for a brief. A configuration contains the list of material (furniture, power sources…) that can be utilized in the container shelter.
 
Once a bill of materials is assembled, participants use the Shelter VR application to place the configuration’s material inside the shelter in 3D.

Watch a [video of the project](https://youtu.be/N7BwZ-IQ2H4).

## Requirements
In order to build and run the project you will need:
- a good internet connection (several GB of download)
- some development skills
- some time and patience ;)

You will also need the following:

**Hardware**
- A [Google Daydream View](https://vr.google.com/daydream/) VR headset
- A [Daydream compatible mobile phone](https://vr.google.com/intl/en_uk/daydream/smartphonevr/phones/) (we used a Google Pixel XL)

*Note:* if you do now own this hardware, you can still run the project on your computer with the [Daydream controller emulator](https://developers.google.com/vr/daydream/controller-emulator) (requires an Android phone with a gyroscope).

**Software** (installation instruction follow)
- Android SDK tools
- Unity 5.6.1
- A free Salesforce Developer Edition (DE) organization

## Installation
Follow these installation steps in this precise order.

### Android SDK tools
Install [Android SDK tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads). You can either just install the CLI or the full Android Studio.

Once the tools are installed, make sure that the `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) command is added to your path.
To check that, open a terminal and type `adb version` this should report the adb version:
```
> adb version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.39
Revision 5943271ace17-android
```

### Enable Developer Mode on your phone
Find the instructions to enable the developer mode on your phone (instructions vary depending on the phone model).

Once you have enabled developer mode, enable USB debugging.
Plug in your phone to your computer via USB and set the USB connection mode to 'charge'.

Open a terminal and type `adb devices` this should report something like this:
```
> adb devices
List of devices attached
* daemon not running. starting it now at tcp:5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
06157df6c8c8c834	device
```

You want to make sure that the status is `device`.

### Clone or download project from git
Start cloning or downloading the project while you continue to setup.

### Install Unity
Install [Unity 5.6.1](https://unity3d.com/).

### Sign up for a Salesforce DE Org
Sign up for a free [Salesforce Developer Edition](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) (DE) organization.

#### Create a Connected App
1. Log in to your DE org.

9. Under **Selected OAuth Scope**, move **Access and manage your data (API)** to the Selected OAuth Scopes list.
10. Click **Save**.
11. From this screen, copy the connect app’s **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** someplace temporarily. You’ll enter this information in Unity after we’re done setting up here.

#### Setup My Domain
1. [Enable My Domain](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=domain_name_setup.htm)
2. Deploy it to your users:
   1. In Setup, enter `My Domain` in the Quick Find box and select **My Domain**.
   2. Click **Deploy to Users**.
   3. Click **OK**.

#### Deploy the Shelter Project package
1. Install the [Shelter Project](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t0Y000001m98Z) package.
2. Using the App Launcher (nine dots icon on the top right), navigate to **Object Definitions** under **All Items**
3. Click **Import**
4. In the left column, switch to **Custom Objects** tab and select **Object Definitions**
5. In the middle column, select **Add new records**
6. In the last column, drag and drop the provided [object_definitions.csv](/object_definitions.csv?raw=true) file
7. Click **Next** in the lower right corner of the screen
8. In the Edit column, click on the **Map** links and associate each record field with a column
9. Map all fields by locating the matching field. When done, click **Next** in the lower right corner of the screen
10. Review the import configuration, it should indicate that your import will include 10 mapped fields.
11. Click **Start Import**

#### Create some sample data
1. Using the App Launcher (nine dots icon on the top right), navigate to the **Shelter Project** app
2. In the **Brief** tab, click **New**
3. Fill the brief information and click **Save**
4. Switch to the **Configuration** tab, click **New**
5. Name your configuration, select the brief you just created and click **Save**
6. Edit your configuration by drag and dropping **Stock** items into the ***Materials** list.

#### Open the ShelterVR Unity project
1. Open Unity
2. In the project list click **Open** and select the directory of the git project (ShelterVR by default)
3. Let Unity load the project (it takes a few minutes the first time)

After loading the project, you will get a couple of warnings and errors (these will vary across versions and environments).
Theses errors and warning are visible in the **Console** window. If the console is not visible, open it with the **Window > Console** menu.

Here are some of the errors you may get:
- Unable to parse YAML file
- Unable to parse *<FILE>*.meta
- Compilation errors related to GvrController
- ImportFBX Errors

Here are some the warning you may get:
- Use of UNITY_MATRIX_MV is detected
- File 'Character_woman' has animation import warnings

You should be able to safely ignore those for now as we will correct them by switching the target platform to Android in the next step.

#### Switch to an Android build
1. Open the **File > Build Settings** menu
2. Select **Android** as the Platform
3. Select **ETC2 (GLES 3.0)** as the Texture Compression
4. Click on **Switch Platform** and wait a couple of minutes for the project to convert (this takes more than 10 minutes of low-end machines)

Once converted into an Android project, the compilation errors should be gone.

#### Setup the OAuth connection
1. In the **Project** window, navigate the tree to **Assets > scripts**
2. Double-click on **SalesforceAuthConfig** in the list of resources at the right of the tree. This will open the code editor (MS Visual Studio or MonoDevelop)
3. Fill in the constant values with the OAuth settings you saved when you created the Connected App in Salesforce
4. Optionally fill in your username and password to save some time for your tests
5. Close the code editor

#### Run a test in Unity
Before deploying to Android, we need to test the project in Unity to save some time. We want to make sure that the authentication flow works as expected.

1. In the **Project** window, navigate the tree to **Assets > Scenes**
2. Double-click on **Menu** in the list of resources at the right of the tree. This will open the main menu scene.
3. Make sure that the **Console** window is visible
4. Click on the **Play** (icon) button on the top center of the window to start the play mode

At this point you will get 2 warnings in the console that you can safely ignore:

>VRDevice daydream not supported in Editor Mode.  Please run on target device.

This indicates that we are testing a Daydream scene in the editor.

> Failed to setup port forwarding. Exit code 1 returned by process: CMD.exe /k adb forward tcp:7003 tcp:7003 & exit
error: no devices/emulators found

This appears when we are trying to run a Daydream scene without a controller emulator. You can set up the emulator later if you wish to test the whole project but for now we are just going to test the authentication flow before deploying on Android.

5. Use your mouse and keyboard in the **Game** window to input your **Username** and **Password** and click on **Log In**
6. Watch the output of the **Console** to validate that the authentication works. If the authentication succeeded, you should now see the 3D environment with your configuration listed in the game window.
7. Click on the **Play** (icon) button on the top center of the window to stop the play mode

#### Build and run on Android
Now that our authentication flow is operational, let's build and deploy on Android.

1. Make sure that:
   1. Android is still the target platform
   2. You phone is plugged in via USB
   3. ADB can access it (run `adb devices` as mentioned earlier)
2. Open the **File > Build Settings** menu
3. Click **Build And Run**.

This will take a couple minutes.
If everything goes well, the ShelterVR app will be built, deployed on your phone and started.

Congratulations, you made it!

#### ADB command cheat sheet
When running on Android, access the app logs in real-time by running `adb logcat -s Unity` in a terminal.<br/>
Use `adb logcat -c` to clear the Android logs.

Use `adb install -r build.apk` to deploy your APK on your phone.
